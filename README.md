# vagrant configuration files

* Install vagrant
* Install VirtualBox
* Clone this repository
* Run `vagrant up` in the directory for the environment you want to create. This will take quite a while the first time as the vagrant box file is downloaded.

Default `vagrant` user password should be `vagrant`.
